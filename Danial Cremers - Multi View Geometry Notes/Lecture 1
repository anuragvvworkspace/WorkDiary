    - Inner product
	- Canonical Inner product
	- Kronecker Product and Matrix Stacking
	- u^T * A * v = ( v (kronecker produt oxo) u )^T * A
	- ring: closed under matrix multiplixation and summation
	- Linear groups G
	- General linear group: Group of matrices that have inverse(are non-singular)
	- Special linear group: Group of Matrices that have det = 1. Note: their inverse also lies in the group(closeness of group)	
	- Representing groups by matrices.
	- group homomorphism
	- Affine transformation: Forms a group G(n)
	- Homogeneous affine matrix also forms a group G(n+1) 
	- Orthogonal group
