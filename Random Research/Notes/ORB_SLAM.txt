Initialization
	-  points can be initialized with high uncertainty in depth using an inverse depth parametrization
	
Monocular SLAM
	-  MonoSLAM was initially solved by filtering, processing every frame. . It has the drawbacks of wasting computation in processing consecutive frames with little new information and the accumulation of linearization errors.
	-  keyframe based selects only few keyframes for a more costly BA algorithm.

	Tracking :
		- We perform first an initial feature matching with the previous frame and optimize the pose using motion-only BA.
		- cOnstant velocity model to predict camera pose and perfomr a guided search.
