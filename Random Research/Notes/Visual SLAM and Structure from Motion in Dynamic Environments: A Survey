Motion Segmentation: 
	B/F Initialization:
		Mostly uses tracking-by-detection scheme. Meaning the features of the 
		dynamic object are already known.
	
	Geometric constraints:

		Lin et al. [95] detect moving objects based on an observation that misclassifying a moving object
		into a static object and incorporating it into the pose estimation would significantly degrade the
		SLAM performance. They compute the difference of pose estimation under two distinct conditions,
		one without adding the detected new feature and the other one with including the new feature
		under assumption that it is stationary. By computing the distance between the two results, setting a
		threshold value, and integrating it through a binary Bayes filter, they are able to segment stationary
		and moving features with high accuracy.

		[74] Moving Object Detection using optical flow. :
			This paper points out one usefull thing. Epipolar constraints and trifocal/trilinear constraint.
		[30[[31] uses stereo. So not applicable here.
		
	Ego-motion Constraints:
		133,136
		Not applicable sice we dont have any constraint on our camera motion.
